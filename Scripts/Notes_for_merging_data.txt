#Commands and scripts to merge data from the same library that has been run on multiple flowcells (and has the exact same name)
#Written to work on Ruddle servers
#Symlinks wont work because you can't cat across them

#first, make a directory for all of the data (e.g. Batch_3)

mkdir Batch_3

#Make subdirectories for each flowcell the library was run on (e.g. if it was run on two flowcells)

mkdir Run_1
mkdir Run_2

#Recursively copy all subdirectories and files YCGA source for each run in the new "Run_1" subdirectory. Must point to directory where YCGA placed data (hardcoded)

cp -r /path/to/where/data/is .

#Now you have a directory with two subdirectories, Run_1 and Run_2, that contain all of the respective subdirectories and contents for each sample on each run
#Example:

Sample_Yale-243
Sample_Yale-248
Sample_Yale-253
Sample_Yale-258

#Each of these subdirectories contain the R1.fastq.gz and R2.fastq.gz

#Now create a list of each of the unique file names for each sample. This can easily be done by capturing the output of 'ls' in a seperate text file e.g.

ls /path/to/sample/subdirectories > temp_list.txt

#The YCGA appends each of the begining of each sample name with the text "Sample_". This needs to be removed for our processing script. 
#The output of the above command will read:

Sample_Yale-243
Sample_Yale-248
Sample_Yale-253
Sample_Yale-258


#We can remove text from a line list of characters using bash commands.
#To remove 'Sample_' from the temp_list.txt file, run

cut -c8- temp_list.txt > list.txt

#The list.txt file will now read

Yale-243
Yale-248
Yale-253
Yale-258

#We can now run our 'Loop_processing.bash' script with this list.txt file to run the 'Cat_data_across_runs.bash' script
